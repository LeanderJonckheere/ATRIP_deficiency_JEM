The provided code for creation of the figures begins from the 
preprocessed Seurat objects, which have been processed according to the Seurat 
v5 workflow, starting from the count matrices. Seurat is an R package designed 
for QC, analysis, and exploration of single-cell RNA-seq and multi-omics data, 
developed by Satijalab. Seurat aims to enable users to identify and interpret 
sources of heterogeneity from single-cell transcriptomic measurements, and to 
integrate diverse types of single-cell data. The paper is currently in preprint at 
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.22.24310550. The data are available at NCBI
GEO under accession number GSE284526.
